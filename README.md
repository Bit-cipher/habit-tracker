# habit-tracker
📖 User Story
As a person trying to build consistent daily habits,
I want a decentralized habit tracker that counts my daily check-ins on the blockchain,
So that I have an immutable, verifiable record of my consistency that I truly own and can prove to others or use as collateral for commitment contracts.

Key Features

Initialize personal habit counters on-chain
Increment counter once per day when checking in
Prevent gaming the system with cooldown periods
View total streak count and last check-in time
Immutable proof of consistency stored on Solana
